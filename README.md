Hereâ€™s a template for your `README.md` that outlines the setup and usage for 
# Bookstore API

A RESTful API for managing a bookstore. This API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and authors.

## Features

- Manage authors: Create, read, update, and delete authors.
- Manage books: Create, read, update, and delete books.
- Query books by author.
- Validation and error handling.
- TypeScript for type safety.
- Express for the web framework.
- Knex for query building with MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/M360ICT_task.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd bookstore-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://newuser:password@localhost:3306/bookstore_db
   ```

   Replace `mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/bookstore` with your actual database connection string. Adjust for PostgreSQL if needed.

2. Set up the database schema:

   - Ensure MySQL or PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Run the database migrations to set up the schema. (Refer to your specific migration tool documentation for exact commands.)

## API Endpoints

### Authors

- **GET /authors**: Retrieve a list of all authors.
- **GET /authors/:id**: Retrieve details of a single author.
- **POST /authors**: Create a new author.
- **PUT /authors/:id**: Update an existing author.
- **DELETE /authors/:id**: Delete an author.

### Books

- **GET /books**: Retrieve a list of all books. Optionally filter by author using the `author` query parameter.
- **GET /books/:id**: Retrieve details of a single book.
- **POST /books**: Create a new book.
- **PUT /books/:id**: Update an existing book.
- **DELETE /books/:id**: Delete a book.

## Error Handling

Errors are returned with appropriate HTTP status codes and JSON responses. For validation errors, a 400 status code is returned with details of the validation issues.

## Running the Project

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## Testing

To test the API, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to make requests to the endpoints. Ensure that your database is properly set up and running before testing.
